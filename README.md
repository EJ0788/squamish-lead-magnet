## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these three variables:

### Required Variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Where to Get It |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| `GAMMA_URL` | Your Gamma presentation URL | Copy from Gamma (share link) |
| `LOFTY_API_KEY` | Your Lofty API key | Lofty → Settings → Integrations → API |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Your email API key | See Step 4 below |

3. Click **"Save"**
4. Redeploy your project (it will auto-redeploy after saving variables)

---

## 📧 Step 4: Set Up Email Service (10 minutes)

### Option A: Resend (Recommended - Free)

1. Go to **https://resend.com/signup**
2. Verify your email
3. Go to **API Keys** → Create new key
4. Copy the key → Add to Vercel as `RESEND_API_KEY`
5. Add your domain (or use their test domain for now)
6. Update the "from" email in `submit-lead.js`:
   ```javascript
   from: 'Squamish Real Estate <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
   ```

**Free tier:** 100 emails/day, 3,000/month - perfect for getting started!

### Option B: SendGrid (Alternative)

1. Go to **https://sendgrid.com/free/**
2. Create account → Verify email
3. Go to Settings → API Keys → Create API Key
4. Copy key → Add to Vercel as `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
5. Uncomment the SendGrid section in `submit-lead.js` (lines marked)

---

## 📱 Step 5: Set Up Phone Verification (Optional but Recommended)

### Option A: Demo Mode (Current Setup)
- Phone verification works in "demo mode"
- Code is logged to console (visible in Vercel logs)
- **Good for testing**, not for production

### Option B: Twilio SMS (Production Ready)

1. Sign up at **https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio** (free trial)
2. Get your credentials:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - Phone Number (they give you one free)
3. Add to Vercel Environment Variables:
   - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
4. In `submit-lead.js`, uncomment the Twilio section (lines 49-69)
5. Comment out the demo mode section (lines 76-82)
6. Redeploy

**Cost:** ~$0.0075 per SMS (very cheap)

## 🔗 Step 6: Lofty CRM Integration

### Check Your API Connection:

1. Go to Lofty → **Settings** → **Integrations** → **API**
2. Copy your API key
3. Test it works by checking Vercel Function Logs:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → **Logs**
   - Submit a test lead through your form
   - Look for "Lead sent to Lofty successfully" or error messages

### Troubleshooting Lofty:

If leads aren't appearing in Lofty:
- Double-check the API key is correct
- Make sure you're using the API key from Settings → Integrations (NOT from CMS)
- Check Vercel logs for specific error messages
- Verify your Lofty account has API access enabled

### Alternative: Webhook Method

If the API continues to fail:
1. Uncomment the webhook section in `submit-lead.js` (lines 169-177)
2. Use Make.com (free) or Zapier to catch the webhook
3. Have it create the lead in Lofty
4. Add webhook URL to Vercel as `LOFTY_WEBHOOK_URL`

---

## 🎨 Step 7: Customize Your Form

### Update Branding:
Edit `public/index.html`:
- Line 1: Update meta description
- Line 52-53: Update headline and description text
- Colors: Change gradient colors (lines 16, 134, 199, 322)

### Add Your Logo:
```html
<!-- Add before line 52 -->
<img src="your-logo-url.png" alt="Logo" style="max-width: 200px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
```

### Google Ads Conversion Tracking:
In `index.html` around line 327, update:
```javascript
gtag('event', 'conversion', {
    'send_to': 'AW-YOUR_CONVERSION_ID/YOUR_CONVERSION_LABEL',
    'value': 1.0,
    'currency': 'CAD'
});
```

## 📊 Step 8: Embed in Lofty Website

### Method A: Direct Embed (Recommended)
1. Go to Lofty CMS → Your page
2. Add **"Embed Block"**
3. Paste this code:
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app" 
  width="100%" 
  height="700px" 
  frameborder="0"
  style="border-radius: 10px;">
</iframe>
```

### Method B: Redirect
1. Create a page in Lofty
2. Add a button that links to your Vercel URL
3. Opens in new tab or same page

### Method C: Custom Domain
1. In Vercel → Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain: `leadmagnet.yourdomain.com`
3. Update DNS records as Vercel instructs
4. Much cleaner URLs for ads!
